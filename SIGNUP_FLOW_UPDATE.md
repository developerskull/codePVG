# Signup Flow Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Signup Flow - No Auto-Login** ✅

After signup (both direct registration and LinkedIn OAuth), users are now redirected to the home landing page **without being logged in**.

#### Modified Files:

**`frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
- Updated `register` function to log out the user immediately after signup
- Supabase auto-logs in users on `signUp()`, so we explicitly sign them out
- Clear all session data and localStorage
- Show success toast: "Your account has been created successfully!"

**`frontend/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`**
- Redirect to `/?signup=success` after successful registration
- Added 1.5s delay to allow success toast to be visible

**`frontend/src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`** 
- For new OAuth signups, log out the user immediately
- Redirect to `/?signup=success` instead of auto-login
- Existing OAuth users still login normally

**`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`**
- Converted to client component to handle query parameters
- Detect `?signup=success` parameter and show success toast
- Clean up URL after showing toast

### 2. **Toast Colors Updated** ✅

Changed toast notification colors to use dark red for errors and green for success.

**`frontend/src/components/ui/toast.tsx`**
- **Success toast**: Dark green background (`bg-green-600`) with white text
- **Error toast**: Dark red background (`bg-red-900`) with white text
- Improved visibility and contrast

### 3. **Button Text Updates** ✅

**`frontend/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx`**
- LinkedIn button now says "LinkedIn" (simplified)

**`frontend/src/app/auth/pending-approval/page.tsx`**
- Removed "Back to Login" button
- Only "Go to Home" button with black background

## How It Works Now

### Direct Signup Flow:
1. User fills registration form
2. Account created in Supabase
3. User profile created in database
4. User immediately logged out (no auto-login)
5. Redirect to home page with success toast
6. Success toast shows: "Your account has been created successfully!"

### LinkedIn OAuth Signup Flow:
1. User clicks "LinkedIn" button
2. Redirected to LinkedIn for authentication
3. Returns to callback page
4. New profile created in database
5. User immediately logged out (no auto-login)
6. Redirect to home page with success toast
7. Success toast shows: "Your account has been created successfully!"

### LinkedIn OAuth Login Flow (Existing Users):
1. User clicks "LinkedIn" button
2. Redirected to LinkedIn for authentication
3. Returns to callback page
4. User profile found in database
5. User logged in successfully
6. Redirect based on approval status:
   - Pending → `/auth/pending-approval`
   - Approved → `/dashboard`
   - Other → `/` (home)

## Toast Notifications

### Success Toast (Green):
- Background: `bg-green-600` (dark green)
- Text: White
- Border: `border-green-700`
- Examples:
  - "Signup successful - Your account has been created successfully!"
  - "Login successful - Welcome back!"

### Error Toast (Dark Red):
- Background: `bg-red-900` (dark red)
- Text: White  
- Border: `border-red-700`
- Examples:
  - "Signup error - Email already exists"
  - "Login error - Invalid credentials"

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Signup logout logic
2. ✅ `frontend/src/app/auth/register/page.tsx` - Redirect to home after signup
3. ✅ `frontend/src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx` - OAuth signup logout logic
4. ✅ `frontend/src/components/ui/toast.tsx` - Dark red and green colors

## User Experience

### Before:
- ❌ User auto-logged in after signup

- ❌ Multiple buttons on pending page

### After:
- ✅ User NOT logged in after signup (lands on home page)
- ✅ Clear success message with dark green toast
- ✅ Clean, simple pending approval page
- ✅ Consistent experience for both signup methods

## Next Steps for Users

After signup, users should:
1. See the success toast on home page
2. Wait for admin approval (24-48 hours)
3. Receive email notification when approved
4. Return to login page to access their account
